# flutter_strudel

Flutter client for Strudel, built on the `strudel_dart/` core port.

## Supported Commands

```sh
flutter pub get
flutter run
flutter test
dart format .
```

## Notes

- Uses a path dependency on `../strudel_dart`.
- Web build currently embeds the web REPL rather than running the Dart engine.
